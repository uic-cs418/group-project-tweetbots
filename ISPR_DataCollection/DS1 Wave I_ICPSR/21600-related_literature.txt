Abstract: https://www.ncjrs.gov/app/publications/abstract.aspx?id=272085
The study used nationally representative data from the National
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) to compare
psychosocial maturity for three groups of adolescents. The groups consisted
of those placed in juvenile confinement before age 18, those arrested
before age 18 but not confined, and those with no involvement in the
justice system in adolescence. Psychosocial maturity was measured on three
dimensions: responsibility, temperance, and perspective at Waves 1
(baseline, average age of 15.44) and Wave 3 (post-confinement, average age
28.31). The intent was to assess the effects of confinement and
psychosocial maturity on markers of a successful transition to adulthood at
Wave 4 (average age of 28.31). The findings indicate significantly lower
levels of psychosocial maturity for confined youth in the areas of
responsibility and perspective compared to non-delinquent youth and non-
confined delinquent youth. These findings suggest that juvenile
correctional facilities should feature programming that enables confined
youth to develop skills associated with psychosocial maturity. Activities
while confined should mirror typical adolescent responsibilities,
behaviors, and tasks. 5 tables, 3 figures, and 41 references

Abstract: https://www.ncjrs.gov/app/publications/abstract.aspx?id=272085
The study used nationally representative data from the National
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) to compare
psychosocial maturity for three groups of adolescents. The groups consisted
of those placed in juvenile confinement before age 18, those arrested
before age 18 but not confined, and those with no involvement in the
justice system in adolescence. Psychosocial maturity was measured on three
dimensions: responsibility, temperance, and perspective at Waves 1
(baseline, average age of 15.44) and Wave 3 (post-confinement, average age
28.31). The intent was to assess the effects of confinement and
psychosocial maturity on markers of a successful transition to adulthood at
Wave 4 (average age of 28.31). The findings indicate significantly lower
levels of psychosocial maturity for confined youth in the areas of
responsibility and perspective compared to non-delinquent youth and non-
confined delinquent youth. These findings suggest that juvenile

Attainment During High School." Presented at the American Sociological
Association, San Francisco, CA, 2004.
Abstract: https://www.ncjrs.gov/app/publications/abstract.aspx?id=272085
The study used nationally representative data from the National
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) to compare
psychosocial maturity for three groups of adolescents. The groups consisted
of those placed in juvenile confinement before age 18, those arrested
before age 18 but not confined, and those with no involvement in the
justice system in adolescence. Psychosocial maturity was measured on three
dimensions: responsibility, temperance, and perspective at Waves 1
(baseline, average age of 15.44) and Wave 3 (post-confinement, average age
28.31). The intent was to assess the effects of confinement and
psychosocial maturity on markers of a successful transition to adulthood at
Wave 4 (average age of 28.31). The findings indicate significantly lower
levels of psychosocial maturity for confined youth in the areas of
responsibility and perspective compared to non-delinquent youth and non-
confined delinquent youth. These findings suggest that juvenile
correctional facilities should feature programming that enables confined
youth to develop skills associated with psychosocial maturity. Activities
while confined should mirror typical adolescent responsibilities,
behaviors, and tasks. 5 tables, 3 figures, and 41 references
