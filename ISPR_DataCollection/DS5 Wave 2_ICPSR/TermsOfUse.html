<p>The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Carolina Population Center National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health Data Use Agreement for the Use of Public-Use Data
<p><strong>I. Definitions</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A. &ldquo;The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health&rdquo; (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;Add Health&rdquo;) is the program project undertaken by the Carolina Population Center of The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (hereafter referred to as &ldquo;UNC-Chapel Hill&rdquo;) under Grant No. P01-HD31921 from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">B. &ldquo;Sensitive Data&rdquo; includes any data from Add Health that might compromise the anonymity or privacy of respondents to that study. Because of the school-based study design, Add Health respondents (adolescents, parents, and schools) are at higher risk of deductive disclosure than randomly sampled individuals. Therefore, all data collected from Add Health are considered to be sensitive.</p>
<p><strong>II. Obligations of the Data User</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Data Files provided under this Agreement shall be held by the user in confidence and can be disclosed only in compliance with the terms of this Agreement.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The user shall abide by the terms of this Agreement, and agrees
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A. That the Data Files will be used solely for statistical analyses: that no attempt will be made to identify specific individuals, families, households, schools, institutions, or geographic locations not provided by Add Health; and that no list of Sensitive Data at the individual or family level will be published or otherwise distributed.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">B. That if the identity of any person, family, household, school, institution or geographic location should be discovered inadvertently, then
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">1. No use will be made of this knowledge;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">2. Add Health will be advised of the incident within ten (10) business days of Investigator&rsquo;s, Research Staff&rsquo;s, or Institution&rsquo;s discovery of the incident;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">3. The information that would identify the person, family, household, school, or institution will be safeguarded or destroyed as requested by Add Health and a written certification of destruction provided to Add Health; and</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">4. No one else will be informed of the discovered identity.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">C. To avoid inadvertent disclosure of persons, families, or households by using the following guidelines in the release of statistics derived from the Data Files.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">1. In no table should all cases in any row or column be found in a single cell.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">2. In no case should the total for a row or column of a cross-tabulation be fewer than ten (10).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">3. In no case should a cell frequency of a cross-tabulation be fewer than ten (10) cases.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">4. In no case should a quantity figure be based on fewer than ten (10) cases.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">5. Data Files released should never permit disclosure when used in combination with other known data.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">D. To include in each written report or other publication based on analysis of Sensitive Data from Add Health, the following statement
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This research uses data from Add Health, a program project designed by J. Richard Udry, Peter S. Bearman, and Kathleen Mullan Harris, and funded by a grant P01-HD31921 from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, with cooperative funding from 17 other agencies. Special acknowledgment is due Ronald R. Rindfuss and Barbara Entwisle for assistance in the original design. Persons interested in obtaining Data Files from Add Health should contact Add Health, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Carolina Population Center, Carolina Square, Suite 210, 123 W. Franklin Street, Chapel Hill, NC 27516 (addhealth_contracts@unc.edu). No direct support was received from grant P01-HD31921 for this analysis.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">E. That all journal articles based on analysis of confidential Sensitive Data from Add Health receive a PubMed Central reference number (PMCID). Journal articles must be submitted to PubMed Central to receive a PMCID. The method of PubMed Central submission and Investigator responsibility for submission depend on the journal and journal publisher.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">1. Some journals automatically submit published articles to PubMed Central. For a list of journals that submit articles to PubMed Central please visit the NIH website: <a href="http://publicaccess.nih.gov/submit_process_journals.htm">http://publicaccess.nih.gov/submit_process_journals.htm</a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">2. Some journal publishers may submit the articles to PubMed Central automatically or upon request by the author. For a list of journal publishers that submit articles to PubMed Central please visit the NIH website: <a href="http://publicaccess.nih.gov/select_deposit_publishers.htm#b">http://publicaccess.nih.gov/select_deposit_publishers.htm#b</a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">3. If neither the journal nor the journal publisher will submit the article to PubMed Central, the Investigator will be responsible to submit the final peer-reviewed manuscript to PubMed Central via the NIH Manuscript Submission System (NIHMS). For detailed instructions on the process of submitting a journal article to PubMed Central, please see the NIH website: <a href="http://publicaccess.nih.gov/submit_process.htm">http://publicaccess.nih.gov/submit_process.htm</a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(If you have any problems with this process, please contact the NIHMS or PubMed help desk.)</p>
<p>ICPSR further asks that authors of publications based on ICPSR data send copies of their published works or publication references to ICPSR for inclusion in a database of related publications.</p>
<p>In addition, the user acknowledges that the original collector of the data, ICPSR, and the relevant funding agency bear no responsibility for use of the data or for interpretations or inferences based upon such uses.</p>
